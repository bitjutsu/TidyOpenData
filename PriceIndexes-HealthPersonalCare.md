## Variables
In the data provided, the index base year is 2002 (if you are unsure of whether or not this has changed, check the [original data tables](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/cpis13a-eng.htm)).

Variables on rows with time periods beginning with %Δ are the percent change in the index for that particular variable in the time period specified. %Δ(Oct2014-Nov2014) would refer to the percent change in price index between October 2014 and November 2014.

All other variables are in units of the base year of the index (currently 2002).
